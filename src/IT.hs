An IT expression  represents a function of the form:

\[
f(x) = \sum_{i}{w_i \cdot t_i(\prod_{j}{x_j^{k_{ij}})}}
\]

with \(t_i\) being a transformation function.

Any given expression can be represented by a list of terms, with each term
being composed of a transformatioon function and an interaction.
The transformation function is represented by a `Transformation` sum type.
The interaction is represented as an `IntMap Int` where the key is the 
predictor index and the value is the strength of the predictor in this
term. Strengths with a value of zero are omitted.
